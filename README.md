To generate the synthetic lung function dataset, I followed these steps:

Defining Variables:

I decided on the number of samples (num_samples) to generate for the dataset, which in this case is 1000.
I set the seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility (np.random.seed(0)).
I defined arrays for age, gender, height, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain using NumPy's random functions.
Generating Base Tidal Volume:

I calculated the base tidal volume based on age, gender, and height, incorporating some random noise using NumPy's random normal function.
Adjusting Tidal Volume:

I adjusted the base tidal volume based on symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain), incorporating some random noise again.
Creating DataFrame:

I organized the generated data into a Pandas DataFrame named data, with columns for age, gender, height, symptoms, and tidal volume.
Saving Data:

I saved the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'synthetic_lung_function_data.csv' using Pandas' to_csv method.
Reading Data:

I read the saved CSV file back into a DataFrame named data using Pandas' read_csv method.
Preparing Features and Target:

I separated the features (X) and the target variable (y) from the DataFrame.
Train-Test Split:

I split the data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.
Model Training:

I instantiated a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
I trained the model on the training data (X_train, y_train) using the fit method.
Model Evaluation:

I used the trained model to make predictions on the test data (X_test) using the predict method.
I calculated the mean squared error and R^2 score to evaluate the performance of the model.
To ensure that the dataset is sufficient and representative of lung function variations, I considered the following factors:

Variability: I included random noise in the generation of base and adjusted tidal volumes to introduce variability, mimicking real-world scenarios.
Feature Importance: I considered features such as age, gender, height, and symptoms that are known to influence lung function.
Sample Size: I chose a sample size of 1000 to ensure an adequate amount of data for training and testing the model.
Randomness: By setting the seed for the random number generator, I ensured that the dataset generation process is reproducible.
If I encountered any roadblocks during the process, I would have:

Checked for data inconsistencies or errors in the dataset generation process.
Ensured that the features used in the model are relevant and correctly represented in the dataset.
Experimented with different model architectures or hyperparameters to optimize performance.
